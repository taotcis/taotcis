## About the Church in Smyrna

### Core Beliefs and Understanding of the Creator

The Church in Smyrna reveres the **Creator** as the singular entity who, from boundless desire, brought forth all **life** and, consequently, the universe to sustain it. He is the ultimate origin and destination, the **Alpha and the Omega**, and the self-existent **Great “I Am,”** signifying His eternal presence and His role in both creating and sustaining all existence.

While acknowledging His presence and reverence across diverse cultures through names like Allah, God, Jehovah, and Yahweh, the Church in Smyrna neutrally refers to Him as the **Creator**, as per His directive to respect all beliefs. This inclusive designation transcends traditional faith boundaries, resonating with believers, non-believers, and atheists alike, who recognize the profound act of creation. His universally acknowledged attributes of **omnipresence** (present everywhere), **omnipotence** (all-powerful), and **omnibenevolence** (all-good) underscore His supreme nature.

### Foundational Principles

1.  **Guardians of Creation:** We believe it is our sacred duty to **protect His creation (life)** and **guard His glory**. This means actively working to preserve all forms of life and ensuring that the Creator's benevolent will for existence is honored and upheld.
2.  **Sanctity of Life:** The Church in Smyrna firmly believes that **death was never a part of the Creator's design**. Therefore, we are committed to doing everything possible to **prevent it**. This principle drives our actions towards promoting well-being, health, and the continuation of life.
3.  **Righteous Living:** Our faith calls us to **live righteously**. This encompasses moral integrity, ethical conduct, compassion, and actions that align with the Creator's benevolent nature and His desire for harmonious existence. Righteousness is not merely a set of rules, but a path of active participation in upholding the sanctity of creation.
